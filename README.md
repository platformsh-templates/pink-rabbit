# Blackfire.io: Revealing Performance Secrets with Profiling

Well hi there Alice! It seems you've seen a Pink Rabbit and fell into a hole.

This repository is the code of [escape.book.b7e.io](https://escape.book.b7e.io/),
the magical place where you landed.

Your objective is to escape using a codebase, your IDE, [an app](https://escape.book.b7e.io/),
eventually some [documentation](https://docs.blackfire.io/introduction), and
discover a new wizard trick along the way: **Blackfire Profiler**

Luckily, Blackfire is all about understanding how your application is behaving
and reducing the resources it's consuming. It has bionic glasses giving you the
super power to observe your application's real behavior and how its code is executed.

You may have seen a Pink Rabbit checking compulsively their watch?

You get the chance to find your way out and reach the Platform.sh booth at
SymfonyLive Paris 2024. Follow the Pink Rabbit to enter the raffle to win a prize.

Here's what you need to play the game:
- [create a Blackfire account](https://blackfire.io/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=escape_game), if you don't already
  have one
- [Install Blackfire browser extension](https://docs.blackfire.io/integrations/browsers/index?utm_source=github&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=escape_game)
- an IDE

Then, go to [escape.book.b7e.io](https://escape.book.b7e.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=escape_game), profile the page by
clicking the big red button in Blackfire browser extension. Then, check the profile's timeline.

Follow the clues Winky, our Pink Rabbit, left behind them in the profiles and
in this repo.

*Eat me, drink me, profile me*.

You don't need a subscription, that site is freely profilable by all.

Also, you don't need to clone the repository (but you can if you want). Browsing it from here should let you explore the codebase to look for the hint you will discover while profiling the application.

Conveniently, you could have one tab with [the codebase](/tree/main/src), one tab with [escape.book.b7e.io](https://escape.book.b7e.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=escape_game), and eventually one tab with the [documentation](https://docs.blackfire.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=escape_game).
